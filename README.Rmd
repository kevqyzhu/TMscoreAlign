# TMscoreAlign

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

`TMscoreAlign` is an R package that implements the TM-align program in R 
([Zhang & Skolnick, 2005](https://doi.org/10.1002/prot.20264)). 
TM-align is a method for aligning proteins based on TM-score 
(Template Modelling score), which calculates topological similarity between two 
protein structures 
([Zhang & Skolnick, 2004](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gki524)). TM-score 
improves upon existing means of structural comparison such as RMSD 
(root-mean-square deviation) as it is length-independent and more sensitive to 
global similarities between structures rather than local deviations. This 
package is targeted for structural biologists who may use this package to 
investigate different conformations of the same protein, informing a structural
basis of protein functions. The tool includes functions that performs structure 
alignment, calculates TM-scores and RMSD, and visualizes aligned structures. 
`TMscoreAlign` was developed using `R version 4.3.1 (2023-06-16)`, 
`Platform: aarch64-apple-darwin20 (64-bit)` and Running under: 
`macOS Ventura 13.2.1`.

## Installation

data(package = "TMscoreAlign") 
browseVignettes("TMscoreAlign")
```


There are 5 functions in `TMscoreAlign`

`get_alignment`: This function performs structure alignment between two protein 
structures specified by PDB files. First, it selects common residues using a 
user-specified method (either based on 'index' or 'alignment'). Then, the 
alignment parameters, including translation and rotation values, are optimized 
for TM-score (Template Modeling Score) and returned to the user as a list. 
Other values such as TM-score and RMSD are also returned in the list. 

`optimize`: This function performs optimization to improve the alignment of two
protein structures based on their atomic coordinates. The optimization aims to 
find the best parameters that minimize the objective function (TM-score). The 
optimization can be restarted with default values or continue from a given set 
of values.

`get_tmscore`: This function calculates the TM-Score (Template Modeling Score) 
between two protein structures based on their alignment. The alignment is 
performed using the specified method ('alignment' or 'index'). This function is
a wrapper for `get_alignment` so that the user can directly calculate the 
TM-score of two protein structures given their PDB files. 

`get_rmsd`: This function calculates the RMSD (root mean square deviation) 
between two protein structures based on their alignment. The alignment is 
performed using the specified method ('alignment' or 'index'). This function is
a wrapper for `get_alignment` so that the user can directly calculate the 
RMSD of two protein structures given their PDB files.

`visualize_alignment_pdb`: This function visualizes the structural alignment of 
two protein structures by displaying the aligned coordinates in a 3D viewer. The
viewer is set up using `3Dmol`, and the alignment is represented by color-coded 
cartoon-style structures for each protein chain. The user can specify the 
alignment parameters and chain coloration.
