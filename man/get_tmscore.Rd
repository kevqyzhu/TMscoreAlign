\title{Get TM-Score Between Two Protein Structures}
\usage{
get_tmscore(pdb1, pdb2, chain1 = "A", chain2 = "A", method)
}
\arguments{
\item{pdb1}{Character. Path to the first PDB file containing the coordinates
of the first protein structure.}

\item{pdb2}{Character. Path to the second PDB file containing the coordinates
of the second protein structure.}

\item{chain1}{Character. Chain identifier for the first protein structure.
Default is 'A'.}

\item{chain2}{Character. Chain identifier for the second protein structure.
Default is 'A'.}

\item{method}{Character. Alignment method to be used. Options are 'alignment'
for sequence-based alignment or 'index' for index-based alignment.}
}
\value{
The TM-Score between the two protein structures based on the
 specified alignment method.
}
\description{
This function calculates the TM-Score (Template Modeling Score) between two
protein structures based on their alignment. The alignment is performed
using the specified method ('alignment' or 'index'). The TM-Score is a
measure of structural similarity and is commonly used in structural
bioinformatics.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Example 1: Calculate TM-Score using sequence-based alignment
tm_score_seq <- get_tmscore("structure1.pdb", "structure2.pdb", chain1 = 'A',
                             chain2 = 'A', method = 'alignment')

# Example 2: Calculate TM-Score using index-based alignment
tm_score_index <- get_tmscore("structure1.pdb", "structure2.pdb",
                               chain1 = 'A', chain2 = 'A',
                               method = 'index')
}
