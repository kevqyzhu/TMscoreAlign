\title{Write Transformed Coordinates to PDB File}
\usage{
write_pdb(
  alignment,
  outputfile = "out.pdb",
  appended = TRUE,
  pdb1,
  pdb2,
  chain_1,
  chain_2
)
}
\arguments{
\item{alignment}{List. Structure alignment results, including alignment
parameters and transformed coordinates.
 The list should contain the following elements:\cr
 - coord1: 3D coordinates (matrix) of CA atoms for common residues in the
    first structure.\cr
 - coord2: 3D coordinates (matrix) of CA atoms for common residues in the
    second structure.\cr
 - values: Numeric vector. Alignment parameters obtained from structure
  alignment.\cr
 - rmsd: Numeric. Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) between the two protein
  structures.}

\item{outputfile}{Character. The name of the output PDB file to be created
(default: "out.pdb").}

\item{appended}{Logical. If TRUE, the transformed coordinates are appended to
the original coordinates
 in the output PDB file. If FALSE, the output PDB file contains only the
  transformed coordinates.}

\item{pdb1}{Character. Path to the PDB file of the first protein structure.}

\item{pdb2}{Character. Path to the PDB file of the second protein structure.}

\item{chain_1}{Character. Chain identifier for the first protein structure.}

\item{chain_2}{Character. Chain identifier for the second protein structure.}
}
\value{
No return value but a PDB file is written.
}
\description{
This function writes the transformed coordinates obtained from a structure
alignment to a new PDB file. The transformed coordinates are generated by
applying the alignment parameters to the original coordinates of the second
protein structure. The resulting PDB file includes the transformed
coordinates alongside the original coordinates of the first structure.
